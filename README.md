# c920-with-ring-light

Mechanical design for a rather weird C920 webcam mount, with NO microphones, and
with a spot for an old 67mm ring light.

This is based on the PCB outline files from John on GrabCAD here,
https://grabcad.com/library/logitech-c920-pcb-1

And it's intended for use with the 12mm lens mount adapter from matthewlai on
